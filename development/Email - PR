Hello!

My name is Kevin Wells. I would like to submit to you my game: Bit Beast, for review.

It's a virtual pet inspired by the great toys from the 90s.
You raise and care for your Bit Beast by feeding him, cleaning him, giving him medicine when he is sick, playing with him, and so on.
It is a singleplayer (with a dash of multiplayer) game for Android.

If you are interested in reviewing the game (or want to know more), you can grab a copy of the game here: http://cheeseandbacon.org/review-copies/bit-beast.apk
