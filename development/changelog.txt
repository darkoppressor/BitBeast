1.1.0 - 2016/11/30
 - Two new stats added: Dexterity and Stamina
   These each function kind of like one half of strength
   Strength is attack damage as well as health
   Stamina provides extra health that must be removed before strength can be damaged, thus acting like a "shield"
   Dexterity provides a damage bonus but gets used up as you attack,
   thus giving you a large damage burst at the beginning of a battle
 - Training now increases max Dexterity and max Stamina in addition to max Strength
 - Each pet evolution branch now represents a distinct "class," with its own unique set of stat priorities
 - Added levels and experience. When you level up, you get stat points to spend on improving your stats
 - Split the store into 4 separate sections
 - Added "permanent" items which are one-time purchases kept in the yard
   Rumor has it they have other benefits...
 - Consumable items can now grant a wide variety of temporary buffs
 - Added some new consumable items
 - All consumable items now have a "primary affected stat," which is what limits their use
   I.e., most food items won't allow you to eat them once your food bar is full
   However, junk food won't allow you to eat it once your HAPPY bar is full
 - Weight now plays a larger role in things. Specifically, being obese (>30 kg) is penalized more
 - The old win/loss ratio is multiplayer win/loss, and there is now a new singleplayer win/loss ratio, too
   Note that old cemetery entries will look a little silly having "0" for so many new things
 - Rewards for various activities are now all merged into one system, in which a Rewards window pops up after
   you are done playing. This means that everything has experience and bit rewards
 - Bit reward on battle victory scaled by max stat difference of opponents
 - Max stat increase on successful training now scales by AI opponent difficulty
 - Max stat gains from training are now capped on a per-tick basis
 - Increased the rate of max stat gain from training
 - Natural temperature change slowed dramatically

 - Added some more brick layouts

   its favorite food because of this
