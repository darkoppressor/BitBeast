Little animation for cleaning up individual poop?

Can text on action bar use custom font?

Sometimes transitions seem slow

Add support for the Android backup/restore system?

Can the store pages be all one activity and just scroll to the side via dragging?

Brick game takes too long to complete
More brick game templates?

Battle menu should show nearby paired devices with bit beast running
Battle requests can be sent to a bit beast regardless of whether it's on the battle screen
When you receive a battle request, you must accept or deny it
Add a setting to ignore battle requests
Allow this setting to be toggled in config screen and also on battle accept screen
Add a screen that the battle started waits on while the other person chooses whether to accept it
When in battle screen, NFC to another device will auto pair them, regardless of whether second person is even running bit beast
Battle screen should have explanation about NFC pairing stuff
Help screens should explain pairing in case user needs to do it themselves, for instance if they don't have NFC
