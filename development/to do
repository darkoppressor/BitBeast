Keep widget? Or just get rid of it?
I like the idea of removing it, and eventually adding a notifications feature instead

Colors are still not applying to the widget pet image

Font is normal one on text and buttons for shop select, temperature, battle select, game select
OK... also sometimes it is correctly the paper cuts font...

Can text on action bar use custom font?

Sometimes transitions seem slow

For the games with just info showing (gps games etc), maybe show some explanation for how they work

Color picker is way too small

NFC that works like Bluetooth for battles?
Maybe this would just make connecting via Bluetooth easier

Add support for the Android backup/restore system

Battle button grayed out when it should not be

Hubert got added twice to the cemetery

See if any specific sounds are slowing loads

Widget definitely needs to scale better
Can I make it change what it displays based on its size, or scale the whole thing?
If I do whole scaling might need multiple sized Widgets

Widget background should scale better
Current widget becomes large version
Add a smaller one

Click or swipe poop to clean up individual poops?
Sound effect half-volume yard cleaning sound?
Little animation for cleaning up individual poop?

The help pages need an overhaul. Wait until the new version is done though
