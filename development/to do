Atomic saves
Limit saving to improve performance
This should mean the backup system below is not needed

Keep widget? Or just get rid of it?
I like the idea of removing it, and eventually adding a notifications feature instead

----------------------------------------------------------------

Bluetooth battles should check that the version of the two players is the same

Battle button grayed out when it should not be

When ticks are processed, they should use the same seed every time, assuming everything starts the same
So maybe use the last tick thing or something as a seed

See if any specific sounds are slowing loads

Widget definitely needs to scale better
Can I make it change what it displays based on its size, or scale the whole thing?
If I do whole scaling might need multiple sized Widgets

Widget background should scale better
Current widget becomes large version
Add a smaller one

Click or swipe poop to clean up individual poops?
Sound effect half-volume yard cleaning sound?
Little animation for cleaning up individual poop?

The help pages need an overhaul. Wait until the new version is done though

Shadow Battle froze the game and eventually crashed: out of memory?

Hubert got added twice to the cemetery

----------------------------------------------------------------

Save data backup. Works much like Hubert
Only save backup data on app close
MAYBE switching activities? But nowhere else

Catch save data corruption when loading, and force the game into a new activity for dealing with this issue
Add a button for replacing save data with backup if one is available
Add a button for erasing save data and starting fresh. Add instructions for if all fails
For this stuff, "save data" should probably mean everything (options, records, pet data) to be safe
Better yet, it could check all these different data files when starting the activity,
and only operate on the offending file(s)

Don't forget to update the Support FAQ on the forums when this is done
